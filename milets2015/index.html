            <h2>SIGKDD Workshop on Mining and Learning from Time Series (MiLeTS)</h2>
            <p>
                Time series data are ubiquitous. The explosion of new sensing technologies (wearable sensors, satellites, mobile phones, etc.), combined with increasingly cheap and effective storage, is generating an unprecedented and growing amount of time series data
                in a variety of domains. The volume and complexity of these data present new and significant challenges to existing and even state-of-the-art methods. The focus of MiLeTS workshop is to synergize the research in this area and discuss both
                new and open problems in time series analysis and mining. The solutions to these problems may be algorithmic, theoretical, statistical, or systems-based in nature. Further, MiLeTS emphasizes applications to high impact or relatively new
                domains, including but not limited to biology, health and medicine, climate and weather, road traffic, astronomy, and energy.

                    Classical approaches to log-linear analysis do not scale beyond about ten variables. By melding the state-of-the-art in statistics, graphical modeling, and data mining research, we have developed efficient and effective algorithms
                    for log-linear analysis, performing in seconds log-linear analysis of datasets with thousands of variables and providing a powerful statistically-sound method for creating compact models of complex high-dimensional multivariate distributions.</p>

                <p><b>Deep Broad Learning: Big Models for Big Data</b><br>
                Deep learning has demonstrated the power of detailed modeling of complex high-order (multivariate) interactions in data. For some learning tasks there is value in learning models that are not only Deep but also Broad. By Broad, we mean models that incorporate evidence from large numbers of features. This is particularly valuable in applications where many different features and combinations of features all carry small amounts of information about the class. The most accurate models will integrate all that information. In this talk, we propose an algorithm for Deep Broad Learning (DBL). The proposed algorithm has only one tunable parameter n, that specifies the depth of the model. We demonstrate that DBL learns models on several big datasets that are highly competitive to those learned by state-of-the-art alternatives.</p>

                Identifying the most influential individuals can provide invaluable help in developing and deploying effective viral marketing strategies. Previous studies mainly focus on designing efficient algorithms or heuristics to find top-K influential nodes on a given static social network. While, as a matter of fact, real-world social networks keep evolving over time and a recalculation upon the changed network inevitably leads to a long running time, significantly affecting the efficiency. In this paper, we observe from real-world traces that the evolution of social network follows the preferential attachment rule and the influential nodes are mainly selected from high-degree nodes. Such observations shed light on the design of IncInf, an incremental approach that can efficiently locate the top-K influential individuals in evolving social networks based on previous information instead of calculation from scratch. In particular, IncInf quantitatively analyzes the influence spread changes of nodes by localizing the impact of topology evolution to only local regions, and a pruning strategy is further proposed to effectively narrow the search space into nodes experiencing major increases or with high degrees. We carried out extensive experiments on real-world dynamic social networks including Facebook, NetHEPT, and Flickr. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art static heuristic, IncInf achieves as much as 21X speedup in execution time while maintaining matching performance in terms of influence spread.

                Certain relational datasets such as those representing social net- works evolve over time, necessitating the development of time- series models where the characteristics of the underlying groups of entities can adapt with time. This paper proposes the Dynamic Gamma Process Poisson Factorization for Network modeling (D- NGPPF) framework, wherein binary network entries are modeled using a truncated Poisson distribution, the ideal number of network groups is discovered from the data itself and the characteristics of these groups smoothly evolve over time using a Gamma-markov chain. Exploiting the properties of the Negative Binomial distribution and a novel data augmentation technique, closed form Gibbs sampling updates are derived that yield superior empirical results for both synthetic and real world datasets.

                Prediction of human activities is important in a wide variety of fields. However, developing activity predictors that work well with the uncertainties surrounding activity data is a challenging task. In this paper, we present activity prediction algorithms that are designed to form accurate predictions in this environment by analyzing the task in the context of time-series mining techniques. We explore factors that contribute to uncertainty in activity data and discuss metrics that can be used to evaluate prediction performance. We evaluate our methods using activity data from 24 physical smart home testbeds and demonstrate that they can achieve reasonable accuracy. We also describe the results of a pilot study using our predictors in an activity prompting app and explore the effects of data variations on user experience.

                The characterisation of time-series data via their most salient features is extremely important in a range of machine learning task, not least of all with regards to classification and clustering. While there exist many feature extraction techniques suitable for non-intermittent time-series data, these approaches are not always appropriate for intermittent time-series data, where intermittency is characterized by constant values for large periods of time punctuated by sharp and transient increases or decreases in value. Motivated by this, we present aggregation, mode decomposition and projection (AMP) a feature extraction technique particularly suited to intermittent time-series data which contain time-frequency patterns. For our method all individual time-series within a set are combined to form a non-intermittent aggregate. This is decomposed into a set of components which represent the intrinsic time-frequency signals within the data set. Individual time-series can then be fit to these components to obtain a set of numerical features that represent their intrinsic time-frequency patterns. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AMP, we evaluate against the real word task of clustering intermittent time-series data. Using synthetically generated data we show that a clustering approach which uses the features derived from AMP significantly outperforms traditional clustering methods. Our technique is further exemplified on a real world data set where AMP can be used to discover groupings of individuals which correspond to real world sub-populations.

                A large body of the forecasting literature so far has been focused on forecasting the conditional mean of future observations. However, there is an increasing need for generating the entire conditional distribution of future observations in order to effectively quantify the uncertainty in time series data. We present two different methods for probabilistic time series forecasting that allow the inclusion of a possibly large set of exogenous variables. One method is based on forecasting both the conditional mean and variance of the future distribution using a traditional regression approach. The other directly computes multiple quantiles of the future distribution using quantile regression. We propose an implementation for the two methods based on boosted additive models, which enjoy many useful properties including accuracy, flexibility, interpretability and automatic variable selection. We conduct extensive experiments using electricity smart meter data, on both aggregated and disaggregated scales, to compare the two forecasting methods for the challenging problem of forecasting the distribution of future electricity consumption. The empirical results demonstrate that the mean and variance forecasting provides better forecasts for aggregated demand, while the flexibility of the quantile regression approach is more suitable for disaggregated demand. These results are particularly useful since more energy data will become available at the disaggregated level in the future.

        <p>
            Submissions should follow the <a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2015/calls.html#calls-cfprt-formatting-requirements">SIGKDD formatting requirements</a> and will be evaluated using the <a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2015/calls.html#calls-cfprt-evaluation-and-decision-criteria">SIGKDD Research Track evaluation criteria</a>.
            Preference will be given to papers that are reproducible, and authors are encouraged to share their data and code publicly whenever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note on <i>open problem</i> submissions:</b> In order to promote new and innovative research on time series, we plan to accept a small number of high quality manuscripts describing <i>open problems</i> in time series analysis and mining.
            Such papers should provide a clear, detailed description and analysis of a new or open problem that poses a significant challenge to existing techniques, as well as a thorough empirical investigation demonstrating that current methods are
            insufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submissions will be managed via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=milets2015">MiLeTS 2015 EasyChair website</a>.
