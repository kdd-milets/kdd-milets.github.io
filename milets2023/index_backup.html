                        Time series data are ubiquitous. In domains as diverse as finance, retail, entertainment, transportation and health care, we observe a fundamental shift away from parsimonious, infrequent measurement to nearly continuous monitoring and recording. Recent
                        advances in diverse sensing technologies, ranging from remote sensors to wearables and social sensing, are generating a rapid growth in the size and complexity of time series archives. Thus, although time series analysis has been
                        studied extensively, its importance only continues to grow. What is more, modern time series data pose significant challenges to existing techniques (e.g., irregular sampling in hospital records and spatiotemporal structure in
                        climate data). Finally, time series mining research is challenging and rewarding because it bridges a variety of disciplines and demands interdisciplinary solutions. Now is the time to discuss the next generation of temporal mining
                        algorithms. The focus of MiLeTS workshop is to synergize the research in this area and discuss both new and open problems in time series analysis and mining. The solutions to these problems may be algorithmic, theoretical, statistical,
                        or systems-based in nature. Further, MiLeTS emphasizes applications to high impact or relatively new domains, including but not limited to biology, health and medicine, climate and weather, road traffic, astronomy, and energy.
                        <br/> The MiLeTS workshop will discuss a broad variety of topics related to time series, including:

                    <p>
                        In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different time points. For example, sensors' observations might not be aligned, time intervals among adjacent readouts can vary across sensors, different samples can have varying numbers of readouts recorded at different times. While machine learning methods usually assume fully observable and fixed-size inputs, irregularly sampled time series raise considerable challenges. In this talk, I will introduce Raindrop, a graph neural network that embeds irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. Raindrop represents every sample as a separate graph, where nodes indicate sensors, and time-varying dependencies between sensors are modeled by a novel message passing operator. I will describe applications of Raindrop to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. Raindrop shows superiority on multiple setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.

                    <h3>Representation and Generation of Clinical Time-Series: Challenges and Opportunities </h3>
                    <p>
                        Multivariate time-series data are frequently observed in various healthcare applications where they are typically characterized by sparsity (missing information) and irregular time intervals. Existing approaches for learning representations in this domain handle these challenges by either aggregation or imputation of values, which in turn suppresses the fine-grained information and adds undesirable noise/overhead into the machine learning model. To tackle this problem, we developed a Self-supervised Transformer for Time-Series (STraTS) model which overcomes these pitfalls by treating time-series as a set of observation triplets instead of using the standard dense matrix representation. Our approach employs a transformer model with a novel Continuous Value Embedding technique to encode continuous time and variable values without the need for discretization. To tackle the problem of limited availability of labeled data, STraTS utilizes self-supervision by leveraging unlabeled data to learn better representations by using time-series forecasting as an auxiliary proxy task. Our results on real-world multivariate clinical time-series benchmark datasets which demonstrate STraTS has better prediction performance than state-of-the-art methods for mortality prediction, especially when labeled data is limited. Towards the end of the talk, I will also describe our recent work on generating medical records using a combination of generative adversarial networks and gated recurrent units.

                    <p>
                        With the decreasing hardware cost and increasing demand for autonomic management, many physical systems nowadays are equipped with a large network of sensors, which generate a huge amount of time series data every day. Due to the high system complexity, however, those time series contain heterogeneous dependencies among different parts across the system and are mixed with noise and operational patterns. It is a challenge to correctly discover the system operational status and healthiness from the collected data. In this talk, I will share our work in transforming the time series data into insight for system’s productivity, reliability and safety. I will start with discovering the “invariants” from massive time series and leveraging those “invariants” for system management. I will then present the deep learning based time series retrieval to digest and compress historical time series for explaining current observations. Finally, I will talk about our work in leveraging the attention mechanism and the prototype learning to discover important patterns from time series. If time is allowed, I will also introduce our recent work that incorporates text data to further interpret the behavior of time series.               </p>

                    <p>
                        Differentiable simulation techniques are the core of scientific machine learning methods which are used in the automatic discovery of mechanistic models through infusing neural network training into the simulation process. In this talk we will start by showcasing some of the ways that differentiable simulation is being used, from discovery of extrapolatory epidemic models to nonlinear mixed effects models in pharmacology. From there, we will discuss the computational techniques behind the training process, focusing on the numerical issues involved in handling differentiation of highly stiff and chaotic systems. The viewers will leave with an understanding of how compiler techniques are being infused into the simulation stack to provide the future of differentiable simulation which merges machine learning with traditional biological and physical modeling.

                    <h3>Interpretable Mixture of Experts for Structured Data</h3>
                    <p>
                         With the growth of machine learning for structured data, the need for reliable model explanations is essential, especially in high-stakes applications. We introduce a novel framework, Interpretable Mixture of Experts (IME), that provides interpretability for structured data while preserving accuracy. IME consists of an assignment module and a mixture of interpretable experts such as linear models where each sample is assigned to a single interpretable expert. This results in an inherently-interpretable architecture where the explanations produced by IME are the exact descriptions of how the prediction is computed. In addition to constituting a standalone inherently-interpretable architecture, an additional IME capability is that it can be integrated with existing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to offer interpretability to a subset of samples while maintaining the accuracy of the DNNs. Experiments on various structured datasets demonstrate that IME is more accurate than a single interpretable model and performs comparably to existing state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of accuracy while providing faithful explanations.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                         In a typical business environment, with new product introductions, new datacenters starting, etc., time series are of uneven length, many are very short. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are well suited to learn from and forecast these kind of data sets, as in contradistinction to CNNs, Transformers, etc., they have memory. The talk will describe a basic well performing RNN system based on LSTMs, and then describe more advanced versions with improved cells and network architecture. Finally, a relatively simple modification will be described that allows to train an RNN to predict any quantile on demand, providing a kind of probabilistic forecast.

                        <b>Note on <i>open problem</i> submissions:</b> In order to promote new and innovative research on time series, we plan to accept a small number of high quality manuscripts describing <i>open
                    problems</i> in time series analysis and mining. Such papers should provide a clear, detailed description and analysis of a new or open problem that poses a significant challenge to existing techniques, as well as a thorough empirical
                        investigation demonstrating that current methods are insufficient.

                    <p class="large text-muted">
                        The review process is single-round and double-blind (submission files have to be anonymized). Concurrent submissions to other journals and conferences are acceptable. Accepted papers will be presented as posters during the workshop and list on the website
                        (non-archival/without proceedings). Besides, a small number of accepted papers will be selected to be presented as contributed talks.
