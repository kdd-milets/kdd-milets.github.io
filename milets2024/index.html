                        Time series data are ubiquitous. In domains as diverse as finance, retail, entertainment, transportation and health care, we observe a fundamental shift away from parsimonious, infrequent measurement to nearly continuous monitoring and recording. Recent
                        advances in diverse sensing technologies, ranging from remote sensors to wearables and social sensing, are generating a rapid growth in the size and complexity of time series archives. Thus, although time series analysis has been studied extensively, its importance only continues to grow. What is more, modern time series data pose significant challenges to existing techniques (e.g., irregular sampling in hospital records and spatiotemporal structure in
                        climate data). Finally, time series mining research is challenging and rewarding because it bridges a variety of disciplines and demands interdisciplinary solutions. Now is the time to discuss the next generation of temporal mining
                        algorithms. 

                        The focus of MiLeTS workshop is to synergize the research in this area and discuss both new and open problems in time series analysis and mining. The solutions to these problems may be algorithmic, theoretical, statistical,
                        or systems-based in nature. Further, MiLeTS emphasizes applications to high impact or relatively new domains, including but not limited to biology, health and medicine, climate and weather, road traffic, astronomy, and energy.
                        <br/> The MiLeTS workshop will discuss a broad variety of topics related to time series, including:

                    <h3>Modern Aspects of Time Series Forecasting </h3>
                    <p> Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in automating and optimizing business processes. In recent years, we have witnessed a significant paradigm shift from traditional model- and assumption-based methods to data-driven, fully automated approaches. This transformation is largely driven by the increasing availability of large, diverse, and complex time series data sources, which in turn present a new set of challenges. In this keynote, we will embark on a comprehensive exploration of probabilistic time series forecasting, beginning with deep models that seamlessly blend the expressive power of neural networks with the data efficiency of classical time series methods. We will then delve into AutoML for time series and discuss the emerging trend of foundation models in this field. Finally, we will explore the practical aspects of building forecasting systems using the AWS Forecasting stack, including tools such as AutoGluon, GluonTS, SageMaker (Canvas), and Amazon Forecast.

                    <h3>New Methods for Robust Time-series Analysis </h3>
                    <p> Sequence modeling at scale is an important problem for many domains like traffic prediction, behavior modeling, network analytics, observability and disease forecasting. Improvements in ML models for sequence prediction have led to improvements in tasks across multiple disciplines. However, most time series prediction models only focus on producing accurate so-called ‘point’ predictions and do not prioritize handling uncertainty and calibrating the (complex, possibly multimodal) predictive distribution itself. This is problematic as providing a trustworthy and reliable estimate is important for real world applications and more generally dealing with uncertain cases during inference. This problem is exacerbated in spatio-temporal forecasting. In this talk, we discuss some of our recent work in advancing the field of multi-variate forecasting with uncertainty and calibration by bridging deep sequential models with Gaussian processes and also using neural models to handle data revisions in real-time. We will also talk about our recent work on enhancing generalizability for time-series analysis by using LLMs and developing principled multi-domain pre-trained models and adapting to industrial use cases.

                    <h3>Convolutional kernels for effective and scalable time series analytics </h3>
                    <p> Time series classification is a fundamental data science task, providing understanding of dynamic processes as they evolve over time. Convolutional kernels provide an effective methods for extracting a wide range of different forms of information from time series data. I present the Rocket family of time series classification technologies that utilize convolutional kernels to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with many orders of magnitude greater efficiency and scalability than any alternative.  These make time series classification feasible at hitherto unattainable scale.  The methods also have potential application across many other forms of time series analysis, including extrinsic regression, clustering, anomaly detection, segmentation and forecasting.

                        <b>Note on <i>open problem</i> submissions:</b> In order to promote new and innovative research on time series, we plan to accept a small number of high quality manuscripts describing <i>open
                    problems</i> in time series analysis and mining. Such papers should provide a clear, detailed description and analysis of a new or open problem that poses a significant challenge to existing techniques, as well as a thorough empirical
                        investigation demonstrating that current methods are insufficient.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="large text-muted">
                        The review process is single-round and double-blind (submission files have to be anonymized). Concurrent submissions to other journals and conferences are acceptable. Accepted papers will be presented as posters during the workshop and list on the website
                        (non-archival/without proceedings). Besides, a small number of accepted papers will be selected to be presented as contributed talks.
