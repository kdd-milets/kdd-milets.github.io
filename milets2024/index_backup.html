                        Time series data are ubiquitous. In domains as diverse as finance, retail, entertainment, transportation and health care, we observe a fundamental shift away from parsimonious, infrequent measurement to nearly continuous monitoring and recording. Recent
                        advances in diverse sensing technologies, ranging from remote sensors to wearables and social sensing, are generating a rapid growth in the size and complexity of time series archives. Thus, although time series analysis has been studied extensively, its importance only continues to grow. What is more, modern time series data pose significant challenges to existing techniques (e.g., irregular sampling in hospital records and spatiotemporal structure in
                        climate data). Finally, time series mining research is challenging and rewarding because it bridges a variety of disciplines and demands interdisciplinary solutions. Now is the time to discuss the next generation of temporal mining
                        algorithms. 

                        The focus of MiLeTS workshop is to synergize the research in this area and discuss both new and open problems in time series analysis and mining. The solutions to these problems may be algorithmic, theoretical, statistical,
                        or systems-based in nature. Further, MiLeTS emphasizes applications to high impact or relatively new domains, including but not limited to biology, health and medicine, climate and weather, road traffic, astronomy, and energy.
                        <br/> The MiLeTS workshop will discuss a broad variety of topics related to time series, including:

                    <h3>Modeling Temporal Data via Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning: A New Framework for Accelerating Scientific Discovery and Addressing Global Environmental Challenges </h3>
                    <p> Ability to effectively model complex temporal data is central to addressing global environmental chal-lenges, as it can improve our ability to understand the behavior of environmental systems and how they respond to changing climate and human actions. Process-based models of dynamical systems are often used to study a variety of environmental systems. Despite their extensive use, these models have several well-known limitations due to incomplete or inaccurate representations of the physical processes being modeled. There is a tremendous opportunity to systematically advance modeling in these domains by using state of the art machine learning (ML) methods that have already revolution-ized computer vision and language translation. However, capturing this opportunity is contingent on a paradigm shift in data-intensive scientific discovery since the “black box” use of ML often leads to seri-ous false discoveries in scientific applications.  Because the hypothesis space of scientific applications is often complex and exponentially large, an uninformed data-driven search can easily select a highly complex model that is neither generalizable nor physically interpretable, resulting in the discovery of spurious relationships, predictors, and patterns. This problem becomes worse when there is a scarcity of labeled samples, which is quite common in science and engineering domains.

                    This talk makes the case that in real-world systems that are governed by physical processes, there is an opportunity to take advantage of fundamental physical principles to inform the search of a physical-ly meaningful and accurate ML model.  While this talk will illustrate the potential of the knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) paradigm in the context of environmental problems (e.g., Fresh water science, Hydrology, Agronomy), the paradigm has the potential to greatly advance the pace of discov-ery in a diverse set of  discipline where mechanistic models are used, e.g., climate science, weather forecasting, and pandemic management.

                    <h3>Robust and Intelligent Time Series Analysis and Applications</h3>
                    <p> In this talk, we present the robust and intelligent approaches toward time series analysis developed by Alibaba DAMO Academy - Decision Intelligence Lab. We will overview our techniques of periodicity detection, trend filtering, and seasonal-trend decomposition, which allow us to handle complex patterns and anomalies with precision. Moving beyond theory, we will discuss how we apply techniques in forecasting and anomaly detection, with an emphasis on explainable electricity forecasting, as well as disucssing our products such as eForecaster and MindOpt, and AIOps solutions. This talk will also highlight how anomaly detection leads to root cause analysis and how forecasting informs decision-making processes, such as autoscaling.

                    <h3>Convolutional kernels for effective and scalable time series analytics </h3>
                    <p> Time series classification is a fundamental data science task, providing understanding of dynamic processes as they evolve over time. Convolutional kernels provide an effective methods for extracting a wide range of different forms of information from time series data. I present the Rocket family of time series classification technologies that utilize convolutional kernels to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with many orders of magnitude greater efficiency and scalability than any alternative.  These make time series classification feasible at hitherto unattainable scale.  The methods also have potential application across many other forms of time series analysis, including extrinsic regression, clustering, anomaly detection, segmentation and forecasting.
