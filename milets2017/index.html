                        Time series data are ubiquitous. In domains as diverse as finance, entertainment, transportation and health care, we observe a fundamental shift away from parsimonious, infrequent measurement to nearly continuous monitoring and recording. Rapid advances
                        in diverse sensing technologies, ranging from remote sensors to wearables and social sensing, are generating a rapid growth in the size and complexity of time series archives. Thus, although time series analysis has been studied
                        extensively, its importance only continues to grow. What is more, modern time series data pose significant challenges to existing techniques (e.g., irregular sampling in hospital records and spatiotemporal structure in climate
                        data). Finally, time series mining research is challenging and rewarding because it bridges a variety of disciplines and demands interdisciplinary solutions. Now is the time to discuss the next generation of temporal mining algorithms.
                        The focus of MiLeTS workshop is to synergize the research in this area and discuss both new and open problems in time series analysis and mining. The solutions to these problems may be algorithmic, theoretical, statistical, or
                        systems-based in nature. Further, MiLeTS emphasizes applications to high impact or relatively new domains, including but not limited to biology, health and medicine, climate and weather, road traffic, astronomy, and energy.
                        <br/> The MiLeTS workshop will discuss a broad variety of topics related to time series, including:

                    <p>
                        In many application scenarios ranging from social networks to IoT, we need to process and analyze a huge amount of data, connected, evolving, linkages being more interesting than entities individually. Modeling such temporal data in nature as graphs provides
                        a conceptually convenient way to support novel and meaningful intelligent applications. At the same time, it also posts grant challenges in many aspects, such as algorithm design and computing system development. In this talk,
                        I will present some interesting and novel application scenarios where graphs play a central role, as well as the corresponding algorithms. Moreover, I will briefly introduce our on-going effort to build a distributed cloud-based
                        graph computing engine that can query huge graphs and networks in seconds.

                    <p>
                        Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to fundamentally shift the way we interact with our surroundings. The challenge of deriving insights from the Internet of Things (IoT) has been recognized as one of the most exciting and key
                        opportunities for both academia and industry. Advanced analysis of big data streams from sensors and devices is bound to become a key area of data mining research as the number of applications requiring such processing increases.
                        Dealing with the evolution over time of such data streams, i.e., with concepts that drift or change completely, is one of the core issues in stream mining. In this talk, I will present an overview of data stream mining, and I will
                        introduce some popular open source tools for data stream mining.

                        Learning With Temporally Uncertain Labels
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        In this talk, I will begin with an overview of the challenges of learning time series event detection models in the emerging area of mobile health or mHealth. mHealth technologies, including on-body physiological sensors, have the potential to yield significant
                        insights into health and behavior. They also offer compelling possibilities for informing the delivery of adaptive health interventions. However, the analysis of mHealth data is often subject to an array of complicating factors
                        at the level of both sensor data and event labels. This talk will focus on the problem of learning time series detection models from temporally imprecise event labels. In this problem, the data consist of a set of input time series,
                        and supervision is provided by a sequence of noisy event time stamps corresponding to the occurrence of positive class events. Such temporally imprecise labels occur in mHealth research both when observers are tasked with precisely
                        labeling the occurrence of short duration events (such as individual puffs on a cigarette), as well as when study subjects are tasked with self-reporting events retrospectively (such as the start and end times of the last time
                        they smoked).

                        <b>Bio</b><br> Benjamin M. Marlin joined the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2011. His research area is machine learning with a focus on the development of customized probabilistic
                        models and approximate inference and learning algorithms. His current research centers on probabilistic models for time series with applications in health and behavioral science. His research has been supported by the National
                        Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, and the US Army Research Laboratory. He is a 2014 NSF CAREER award recipient
                        and a 2013 Yahoo! Faculty Research Engagement Program award recipient. He was previously a fellow of the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences and the Killam Trusts at the University of British Columbia. He completed
                        his PhD in machine learning in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.
