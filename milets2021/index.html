                        Time series data are ubiquitous. In domains as diverse as finance, retail, entertainment, transportation and health care, we observe a fundamental shift away from parsimonious, infrequent measurement to nearly continuous monitoring and recording. Recent
                        advances in diverse sensing technologies, ranging from remote sensors to wearables and social sensing, are generating a rapid growth in the size and complexity of time series archives. Thus, although time series analysis has been
                        studied extensively, its importance only continues to grow. What is more, modern time series data pose significant challenges to existing techniques (e.g., irregular sampling in hospital records and spatiotemporal structure in
                        climate data). Finally, time series mining research is challenging and rewarding because it bridges a variety of disciplines and demands interdisciplinary solutions. Now is the time to discuss the next generation of temporal mining
                        algorithms. The focus of MiLeTS workshop is to synergize the research in this area and discuss both new and open problems in time series analysis and mining. The solutions to these problems may be algorithmic, theoretical, statistical,
                        or systems-based in nature. Further, MiLeTS emphasizes applications to high impact or relatively new domains, including but not limited to biology, health and medicine, climate and weather, road traffic, astronomy, and energy.
                        <br/> The MiLeTS workshop will discuss a broad variety of topics related to time series, including:

                    <h3> Deep Learning Data-driven approaches for Epidemic Forecasting </h3>
                    <p>
                        The devastating impact of the currently unfolding global COVID-19 pandemic and those of the Zika, SARS, MERS, and Ebola outbreaks over the past decade has sharply illustrated our enormous vulnerability to emerging infectious diseases. There are many questions
                        that are being studied by epidemiologists and public officials during these outbreaks. Building on our prior work, we have been pursuing multiple activities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, collaborating with
                        partners in academia, industry and public health agencies, from award-winning work on helping forecast pandemic trajectories (also shown on the CDC website) to designing more localized and less burdensome campus interventions.
                        In this talk, I will briefly give an overview of our recent research in designing well calibrated, robust, accurate and interpretable deep learning models for epidemic forecasting, illustrating the important role data science and
                        machine learning have to play for pandemic prevention and prediction.

                        <b>Bio</b><br> B. Aditya Prakash is an Associate Professor in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology (“Georgia Tech”). He received a Ph.D. from the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University
                        in 2012, and a B.Tech (in CS) from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) -- Bombay in 2007. He has published one book, more than 80 papers in major venues, holds two U.S. patents and has given several tutorials at leading conferences.
                        His work has also received multiple best-of-conference, best paper and travel awards. His research interests include Data Science, Machine Learning and AI, with emphasis on big-data problems in large real-world networks and time-series,
                        with applications to computational epidemiology/public health, urban computing, security and the Web. Tools developed by his group have been in use in many places including ORNL, Walmart and Facebook. He has received several awards
                        such as a Facebook Faculty Award, the NSF CAREER award and was named as one of ‘AI Ten to Watch’ by IEEE. His work has also won awards in multiple data science challenges (e.g the Facebook COVID19 Symptom Challenge) and been highlighted
                        by several media outlets/popular press like FiveThirtyEight.com. He is also a member of the infectious diseases modeling MIDAS network and core-faculty at the Center for Machine Learning (ML@GT) and the Institute for Data Engineering
                        and Science (IDEaS) at Georgia Tech. Aditya’s Twitter handle is @badityap.

                    <h3>Modeling raw, messy time series data with latent stochastic differential equations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Much real-world data is sampled at irregular intervals, but most time series models require regularly-sampled data. Continuous-time models address this problem, but until now only deterministic models (based on ordinary differential equations) or linear-Gaussian
                        models were efficiently trainable with millions of parameters. We construct a scalable algorithm for computing gradients through samples from stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and for gradient-based stochastic variational
                        inference in function space, all with the use of adaptive black-box SDE solvers. This allows us to fit a new family of richly-parameterized distributions over time series, in which neural networks can parameterize both dynamics
                        and likelihoods. We demonstrate these latent SDEs on motion capture data, and provide an open-source PyTorch library for fitting large SDE models.

                    <h3>Irrational Exuberance: Why we should not believe 99% of papers on Time Series Anomaly Detection
                    </h3>
                    In the last five years there has been an explosion of paper on time series anomaly detection (TSAD) appearing in all the top conferences. In this talk I will make a surprising claim. Almost all such papers suffer from various flaws, including: Testing
                    on deeply flawed datasets, use of inappropriate measures of success, non-reproducible experiments, unjustified complexity, and ignoring competitive decades-old methods. I will demonstrate that because of these flaws, we should not
                    believe the claims of most papers on time series anomaly detection. Rather than a completely pessimistic talk, I will take this opportunity to release a new set of 250 benchmark datasets and guidelines that will go some way to mitigating
                    the problems.

                    <h3>On the Interface between Optimal Transport and Time Series </h3>
                    <p>
                        I will start this talk with a short intro to optimal transport theory, and mention a few interesting areas at the intersection of both optimal transport and time series. I will describe in more detail the JKO proximal gradient descent scheme and show
                        how it can be used to model time series of snapshots of populations (joint work with Charlotte Bunne, Laetitia Papaxanthos and Andreas Krause) and also the Wasserstein DTW discrepancy for such time series.

                    <p><b>Bio</b><br> Marco Cuturi joined Google Brain, in Paris, in October 2018. He graduated from ENSAE (2001), ENS Cachan (Master MVA, 2002) and holds a PhD in applied maths obtained in 2005 at Ecole des Mines de Paris. He worked as a
                        post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo, between 11/2005 and 03/2007. He worked in the financial industry between 04/2007 and 09/2008. After working at the ORFE department of Princeton University
                        between 02/2009 and 08/2010 as a lecturer, he was at the Graduate School of Informatics of Kyoto University between 09/2010 and 09/2016 as a tenured associate professor. He then joined ENSAE, the french national school for statistics
                        and economics, in 9/2016, where he still teaches. His recent proposal to solve optimal transport using an entropic regularization has re-ignited interest in optimal transport and Wasserstein distances in the machine learning community.
                        His work has recently focused on applying that loss function to problems involving probability distributions, e.g. topic models / dictionary learning for text and images, parametric inference for generative models, regression with
                        a Wasserstein loss and probabilistic embeddings for words.
